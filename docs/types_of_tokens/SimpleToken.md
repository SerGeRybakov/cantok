The base token is `SimpleToken`. It has no built-in automation that can cancel it. The only way to cancel `SimpleToken` is to explicitly call the `cancel()` method from it.

```python
from cantok import SimpleToken

token = SimpleToken()
print(token.cancelled)  # False
token.cancel()
print(token.cancelled)  # True
```

`SimpleToken` is also implicitly generated by the operation of summing two other tokens:

```python
from cantok import CounterToken, TimeoutToken

print(repr(CounterToken(5) + TimeoutToken(5)))
# SimpleToken(CounterToken(5, direct=True), TimeoutToken(5))
```

There is not much more to tell about it if you have read [the story](../what_are_tokens/in_general.md) about tokens in general.
